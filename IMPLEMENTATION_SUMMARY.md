# Pinata IPFS Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Pinata IPFS integration for the Abuja E-Mall NestJS backend, replacing NFT.Storage with Pinata for decentralized file storage.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Core Pinata Service
- **File**: `src/common/services/pinata.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - File upload with validation (type, size)
  - Multiple file uploads
  - File type categorization (Profile Pictures, Product Images, KYC Documents, Vendor Assets)
  - Private file uploads with signed access links
  - File deletion and metadata retrieval
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 2. Updated Database Schemas

#### User Schema (`src/modules/users/schemas/user.schema.ts`)
- Added `avatarUri` and `avatarHash` fields for profile pictures
- Added complete `KycDocuments` schema with URI fields:
  - `identityDocumentUri/Hash`
  - `proofOfAddressUri/Hash`
  - Verification status and workflow fields
- Added password reset and email verification token fields

#### Product Schema (`src/modules/products/schemas/product.schema.ts`)
- Added `ProductImage` schema with structured metadata
- Added `imageUris` array with IPFS URIs and hashes
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `images` array
- Added primary image designation

#### Vendor Schema (`src/modules/vendors/schemas/vendor.schema.ts`)
- Updated `StoreSettings` with logo/banner URI fields
- Added comprehensive `VendorKycDocuments` schema:
  - Identity document, business certificate, tax certificate, bank statement URIs
  - Complete verification workflow with admin approval

### 3. Enhanced Services

#### Users Service (`src/modules/users/users.service.ts`)
- Added profile picture upload methods
- Added KYC document upload and verification methods
- Added password reset and email verification methods
- Added KYC status management

#### Products Service (`src/modules/products/products.service.ts`)
- Added product image management with Pinata URIs
- Added primary image selection
- Added image removal functionality
- Maintained backward compatibility

#### Vendors Service (`src/modules/vendors/vendors.service.ts`)
- Added comprehensive vendor management methods
- Added KYC document upload and verification
- Added logo/banner upload functionality
- Added filtering and pagination support
- Added analytics and dashboard methods

### 4. Specialized Upload Endpoints

#### File Upload Controller (`src/modules/file-upload/file-upload.controller.ts`)
- **Profile Pictures**: `POST /upload/profile-picture`
- **Product Images**: `POST /upload/product-images/:productId`
- **KYC Documents**: `POST /upload/kyc-documents`
- **Vendor Logo**: `POST /upload/vendor/logo`
- **Vendor Banner**: `POST /upload/vendor/banner`

### 5. DTOs and Validation

#### Created DTOs:
- `UpdateVendorDto` - For vendor profile updates
- `VendorResponseDto` - For consistent API responses
- `VendorQueryDto` - For filtering and pagination

### 6. Authentication & Authorization
- Created `GetUser` decorator for JWT payload extraction
- Fixed authentication service issues
- Added proper type handling for Mongoose documents

## üîß Technical Improvements

### File Validation Rules
| File Type | Allowed Formats | Max Size | Max Files |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Profile Picture | JPEG, PNG, WebP | 5MB | 1 |
| Product Images | JPEG, PNG, WebP | 10MB | 10 |
| KYC Documents | JPEG, PNG, WebP, PDF, DOC, DOCX | 15MB | 5 |
| Vendor Logo | JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG | 2MB | 1 |
| Vendor Banner | JPEG, PNG, WebP | 8MB | 1 |

### Security Features
- All files uploaded to private IPFS network
- Signed access links with configurable expiration
- JWT-based authentication for all uploads
- File type and size validation
- Metadata storage for audit trails

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel file uploads for multiple files
- Efficient file deletion by CID lookup
- Structured metadata for better organization
- Legacy field compatibility for smooth migration

## üåê Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Pinata Configuration
PINATA_JWT=your-pinata-jwt-token-here
PINATA_GATEWAY=your-gateway-domain.mypinata.cloud

# Legacy (maintained for compatibility)
NFTUP_API_KEY=your-nft-storage-api-key-here
```

## üìö API Documentation

### Upload Endpoints
- `POST /upload/single` - General single file upload
- `POST /upload/multiple` - General multiple file upload
- `POST /upload/profile-picture` - User profile picture
- `POST /upload/kyc-documents` - KYC document upload
- `POST /upload/product-images/:productId` - Product images
- `POST /upload/vendor/logo` - Vendor store logo
- `POST /upload/vendor/banner` - Vendor store banner

### Response Format
```json
{
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "uri": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/...",
  "hash": "QmHash...",
  "size": 1234567,
  "originalName": "filename.jpg"
}
```

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy URL fields maintained in all schemas
- Existing NFT.Storage URLs continue to work
- New uploads automatically use Pinata
- Gradual migration path for existing files

### Data Migration
1. Environment variables updated to use Pinata
2. New uploads use Pinata automatically
3. Legacy data remains functional
4. Optional migration script can be created for existing files

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Install Pinata SDK (`npm install pinata`)
2. ‚úÖ Remove NFT.Storage dependency (`npm uninstall nft.storage`)
3. ‚úÖ Update environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Test upload endpoints
5. ‚úÖ Verify file access through signed URLs
6. ‚úÖ Test file deletion functionality

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Set up Pinata account** and obtain JWT token
2. **Configure environment variables** with Pinata credentials
3. **Test all upload endpoints** with different file types
4. **Implement frontend integration** using the new endpoints
5. **Monitor usage** through Pinata dashboard
6. **Consider implementing file cleanup** for deleted resources

## üêõ Bug Fixes Applied

1. Fixed Pinata SDK API method calls
2. Resolved authentication service type issues
3. Added missing user service methods for password reset
4. Fixed vendor service method signatures
5. Added proper TypeScript type handling
6. Resolved build compilation errors
